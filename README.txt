1) Correctly implemented: Part 1
   Not correctly implemented:

2) Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the lab.

3) Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the lab.


Questions
1) Based on the IP addresses and from your analysis in part 1, are you really 
confident that Russians were behind the election security compromises?
    No, based on the analysis, I am not confident that the Russians were behind
    the compromises. The analysis found that only xx IP addresses could be 
    determined as being located in Russia, as compared to 45 for China, 44 for
    the United States, and 628 of which they were unable to even make a 
    definitive location identification. An added complication to this is that
    though they may have made these identifications, it doesn't eliminate the
    possibility that some of the IP addresses said to be located in countries
    other than Russia could have been anyone, even Russians, using proxies. 

    Thus, I am unable to confidently say whether Russians were behind the 
    election security compromises.


2) Are the heuristics used in this lab to determine incidents "even that good"?

3) If you have spare time in the future, what would you add to the program or 
do differently with regards to detecting incidents?
